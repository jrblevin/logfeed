Acknowledgments
===============

 * Rael Dornfest wrote Blosxom, which has served as a model due to
   it's elegant simplicity, as well as many related Blosxom plugins.
   Blosxom itself inspired logfeed's support of entry templates.
   logfeed's pure Perl configuration file framework is based on the
   Blosxom config plugin.  Generation of the Atom itself is based on
   the Blosxom atomfeed plugin.

 * Morten HÃ¸ybye Frederiksen wrote bzr-feed, a simple, focused, and
   extremely useful Python script which in large part inspired this
   project.

 * Frank Hecker, Sam Pearson, and Sam Ruby also contributed to the
   Blosxom atomfeed plugin which I used as a reference and borrowed a
   few things from.
